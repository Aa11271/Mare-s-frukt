YOU! Yes you!
you can change website background which is always blured btw, by replacing
image file with the one you want. simply, let me give you a example:

you have "img1.png" file in your "home_data" folder as a background image
image that you want to put as background must remain "png" file!
take the png picture you want as a background
delete the original "img1.png" file and put the picture you want in folder "home_data"
name of your new background picture must be changed to "img1"
file must be "png" format or this won't work

You are set! refresh the website and check if it worked

if you have any issues, you can email me: milosbarac7@gmail.com
make sure you attach the screenshot of your issue

thats it, thank you for your time. bye.
